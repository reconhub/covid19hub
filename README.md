# RECON COVID-19 Hub

Welcome to the *RECON COVID-19 hub*, a platform for improving COVID-19 analytics
resources in R by bringing together infectious disease modellers,
epidemiologists and R developers. This platform is intended as a repository
for identifying and centralising outstanding R development tasks relevant to the
COVID-19 response, which can then be taken on by the wider R community.

This github page is a *temporary platform* while a fully fledged website is under
development; please read the instructions below on how to use it. You will
require a github account to list new tasks.

### Tasks
All tasks are listed as separate issues on
the [Issues page](https://github.com/reconhub/covid19hub/issues). Tasks are
categorised using [labels](https://github.com/reconhub/covid19hub/labels) and 
will indicate, among other things, the expected skill level and time investment 
required to complete it. Click on a task for more information and post a 
comment if you have any questions, ideas or discussion points.

### Listing a new task
List a new task by clicking on the "New issue" button; please makes sure you
have looked through existings tasks to avoid duplications. Each task listing
should include the following: 

* **Title:** A concise, informative title
* **Description:** A clear overview of the task which provides context,
  identifies key problems and specifies the work to be done, with itemized by 
  deliverables
* **Impact**: A quick explanation of how addressing this task will help improving COVID-19 
  analytics
* **Timeline:** A proposed timeline for the work
* **Focal point:** Indicate the person to contact to discuss this task, ideally through a 
  github user name.
* **Difficulty:** Indicate the *perceived* amount of work (low, medium, high) required to
  complete this task using the appropriate label
* **Priority:** Indicate the *perceived* priority (low, medium, high) of the task using 
  the appropriate label
* **Assignees (optional)**: If you have specific people in mind for your task, feel free to 
  tag them in the issue, but refrain for directly assigning people unless they previously 
  agreed upon; people can assign themselves using the "Assignees" button on the right hand
  side


### Taking on a task
If you have identified a task you would like to work on, assign yourself to the
task by clicking on "Assignees" button on the right hand side. You can get in
contact with the task organiser by posting a comment and then get started!
