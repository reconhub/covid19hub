# RECON COVID-19 Hub

Welcome to the RECON COVID-19 hub, a platform for improving COVID-19 analytics
resources in R by bringing together infectious disease modellers,
epidemiologists and advanced R users. This platform is intended as a repository
for identifying and centralising outstanding R development tasks relevant to the
COVID-19 response, which can then be taken on by the wider R community.

This github page is a temporary platform while a fully fledged website is under
development; please read the instructions below on how to use it. You will
require a github account to list new tasks.

### Tasks
All tasks are listed as separate issues on
the [Issues page](https://github.com/reconhub/covid19hub/issues). Tasks are
categorised using labels and will indicate, among other things, the expected
skill level and time investment required to complete it. Click on a task for
more information and post a comment if you have any questions, ideas or
discussion points.

### Listing a new task
List a new task by clicking on the "New issue" button; please makes sure you
have looked through existings tasks to avoid duplications. Each task listing
should include the following: 

* **Title:** A concise, informative title
* **Description:** A clear overview of the task which provides context,
  identifies key problems and specifies the work to be done
* **Difficulty:** Indicate the skill level (low, medium, high) required to
  complete this task using the appropriate label
* **Time investment:** Indicate the time investment (low, medium, high) required
  to complete this task using the appropriate label
* Assignees (optional): If you have specific people mind for your task, assign
  them using the "Assignees" buttom on the right hand side


### Taking on a task
If you have identified a task you would like to work on, assign yourself to the
task by clicking on "Assignees" button on the right hand side. You can get in
